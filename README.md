**Awesome Startup Employee Directory**

This project demonstrates how to build an app using the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. The app will provide a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

The app will request a JSON object from the Random User Generator API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

**Technologies Used**

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery) to create the necessary functionality. Other frameworks, libraries, or plugins are not permitted.

**Getting Started**
